# Quest Paths

## Folder Structure

Generally, the folder name is derived from SE's classification of quests.

    - Limsa: `ManSea[...]`
    - Gridania: `ManFst[...]`, also includes some latter quests (e.g. Ifrit)

    - Generally, each starting class quest should be in its own city folder, with all shared quests in the `Shared`
      folder
- `MSQ-2`: All quests from `We Come in Peace` until the end of ARR (incl. patches)
